## Sigmund Klåpbakken

Studying electrical engineering at NTNU Trondheim, with a passion for software development, particularly system programming such as operating systems,
compilers and embedded. I have worked on quite a few hobby projects over the years, having started writing software some time in 2017. These projects can
be viewed on this github page and although most of them are not finished, they should give a good insight into my capabilties as a developer.

In my spare time I also volunteer with [Orbit NTNU](https://orbitntnu.com/)'s Embedded Software group, writing and maintaining software for Orbit's own satellites.

### Selected projects:
* Arma 3 related projets: When I first started out developing, I was writing scripts for an Arma 3 server. This lead to me creating some tools to help me navigate through Arma 3's severely flawed ecosystem:
  * [armaconfig.py](https://github.com/SigJig/armaconfig.py): A tool able to parse the config files used by the scripting language SQF, and have it represented in Python objects.
  * [AEWL - Arma Extensible Widget Language](https://github.com/SigJig/aewl): A tool to simplify GUI creation for Arma 3, a unneccesarily painful and annoying process.
  * [sqfpack](https://github.com/SigJig/sqfpack): A tool to simplify project structure when developing in SQF.
  * [untitled-arma-manager](https://github.com/SigJig/untitled-arma-manager): A tool to simplify installation and setup of Arma 3 servers.
  * [YASS - Yet Another SQF Superscript](https://github.com/SigJig/yass-go): A language with the aim to transpile to SQF. Was abanonded early on.
  * [phx-api](https://github.com/SigJig/phx-api): A RESTful API for the server database, meant to replace an older version. Was ready to release but was never released.
  * [sqfcurl](https://github.com/SigJig/sqfcurl): An extension written in C++ to allow for cURL requests from SQF code.
  * [arma-preprocessor](https://github.com/SigJig/arma-preprocessor): An experimental preprocessor for SQF code, written in C++.

* [Advent of Code](https://github.com/SigJig/advent-of-code): A repository containing my attemps at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) over the years.
* [Led strip controller](https://github.com/SigJig/led-strip-controller): A project where I used an Arduino with MOSFETs to control my ledstrip. Had a Python backend and a React frontend.
  * I also started a [version 2](https://github.com/SigJig/ledstrip-v2) of this, taking a slightly different approach.
* [Angel of Death](https://github.com/SigJig/angel-of-death): Inspired by Devon Crawford's [Hardest Computer Science Course Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S20NcDLF_t4), I used this project to learn C. Only the parser was implemented, and was not completely finished.
* [sigunit](https://github.com/SigJig/sigunit): A *very* simple unit testing framework for C, inspired by [MinUnit](https://jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002).
